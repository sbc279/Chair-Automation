# Chair Automation

An easy to assemble product that not only retains your recliner's functionality and buttons, but enhances it with an optional, second generic controller with latch-like abilities. No longer do you have to press a button, hold, and wait! By incorporating a low-cost ($15) microprocessor and easy to use Python programming, the sky's the limit.
This device can also be adapted to control a variety of things, such as a hospital-type of bed, etc.
